"Development Status" refers to how stable the project is.  
"Adaptability" refers to how easy it is to adapt the code beyond my exact use case.

This repository contains projects and information that I use for my hydroponics setup.  
Above, all projects are listed with their relevant statuses displayed.

## General Information

**DISCLAIMER**: I don't have infinite time to research options.  
The following list *does not* and *is not implied to* have perfect choices.

### Grow Units
- 2 x Emsco Group 2370 Hydropickers Compact 24” x 20”
    - *These aren't perfect but they're really convienient. The one I bought from Amazon (as opposed to in a physical store) unfortunately comes with two silicone-sealed holes which may leak in the future.*

### Grow Lights
- 2 x Spider Farmer SF2000
    - *I'm pretty happy with their performance.*
