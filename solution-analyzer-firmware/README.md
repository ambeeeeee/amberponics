# Solution Analyzer Firmware
This is the firmware I use for my nutrient solution analysis device. This allows me to buy one set of very expensive sensors rather than
buying one set per grow unit.

It's intended to not only sample data, but also to calculate and apply corrections to the solution to maintain specified parameters.

It collects information on:
- pH
- Electrical Conductivity (EC)
- Temperature

## Applied Components

These are the components I am currently using with the live system.  

This system is pre-development and thus the list isn't very useful!

### Sensors
- Atlas Scientific Lab Grade pH Probe
- Atlas Scientific Conductivity Probe K 1.0
- Atlas Scientific Standard PT-1000 Temperature Probe

### Microcontroller
- stm32h7b0
